# Folder to upload the files to perform the empirical study of agriculture in Uganda.

## Crop analysis
I make use of the Uganda ISA-LSMS surveys to obtain measures of productivity and risk for the main crops cultivated in Uganda
and input usage: land, capital, intermediary goods (fertilizers+pesticides+insecticides) and labor.
In the datasets each observation corresponds to a plot. Only plots cultivated by one specific crop are taken into account.

## Getting household data:
In the files that end up with _hh each observation corresponds to a household, so variables are aggregate to the household level.
